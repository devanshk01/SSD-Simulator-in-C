# SSD-Simulator-in-C

A lightweight, educational Solid State Drive (SSD) simulator developed in C, designed to emulate basic file storage functionalities. This project was undertaken as part of the **MC214 - Operating Systems** course at [Your Institution Name].

## 📘 Overview

This simulator provides a simplified model of an SSD, focusing on fundamental operations such as file creation, deletion, reading, and writing. It serves as a pedagogical tool to understand the internal workings of SSDs and the associated file management systems.

## 🛠️ Features

- **File Operations**: Simulates basic file operations including creation, deletion, reading, and writing.
- **Block Management**: Implements a rudimentary block management system to allocate and deallocate storage blocks.
- **Wear-Leveling Simulation**: Introduces a basic wear-leveling mechanism to mimic SSD longevity strategies.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Provides a simple CLI for user interaction and testing.

```

## 🧪 Usage
Upon execution, the simulator presents a command-line interface with options to perform various file operations.
Users can input commands to create, read, write, or delete files, and observe how the simulator manages these requests internally.

## 📖 Documentation
Detailed documentation on the simulator's architecture, data structures, and algorithms can be found in the Wiki section of this repository.

## 🎓 Academic Context
This project was developed as part of the curriculum for the MC214 - Operating Systems course, aiming to provide hands-on experience with storage device simulations and deepen understanding of file system operations.
